# Single Asset Staking

## Introduction

Single Asset Staking contracts facilitate collective staking of digital assets and distributing rewards among participants.

This project is funded by the Cardano Treasury in [Catalyst Fund 10](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-developer-ecosystem-the-evolution/anastasia-labs-open-source-production-grade-dapps).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Nix](https://nixos.org) installed on your system. Nix is used for package management and to provide a consistent development environment. If you don't have Nix installed, you can do so by running the following command:

#### Official option

[Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

#### Preferred option

[Determinate Systems](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-installer)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Make sure to enable [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes) by editing either `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` or `/etc/nix/nix.conf` on
your machine and add the following configuration entries:

```yaml
experimental-features = nix-command flakes ca-derivations
allow-import-from-derivation = true
```

Optionally, to improve build speed, it is possible to set up binary caches by adding additional configuration entries:

```yaml
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://cache.iog.io https://cache.zw3rk.com
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= loony-tools:pr9m4BkM/5/eSTZlkQyRt57Jz7OMBxNSUiMC4FkcNfk=
```

To facilitate seamlessly moving between directories and associated Nix development shells we use [direnv](https://direnv.net) and [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv):

Your shell and editors should pick up on the `.envrc` files in different directories and prepare the environment accordingly. Use `direnv allow` to enable the direnv environment and `direnv reload` to reload it when necessary. Otherwise, the `.envrc` file contains a proper Nix target which will be used with the `nix develop --accept-flake-config` command.

To install both using `nixpkgs`:

```sh
nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv
nix profile install nixpkgs#nix-direnv
```

### Building and developing

Once Nix is installed, you should be able to seamlessly use the repository to
develop, build and run packages.

Download the Git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/single-asset-stakinggit
```

Navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
cd single-asset-staking
```

Activate the development environment with Nix:

```sh
nix develop --accept-flake-config
```
Or
```sh
make shell
```

Please be patient when building nix development environment for the first time, as it may take a very long time. Subsequent builds should be faster. Additionally, when you run `nix run .#help` you'll get a list of scripts you can run, the Github CI (nix flake check) is setup in a way where it checks the project builds successfully, haskell format is done correctly, and commit message follows conventional commits. Before pushing you should run `cabal run` , `nix run .#haskellFormat` (automatically formats all haskell files, including cabal), if you want to commit a correct format message you can run `cz commit`

Build:

```sh
make build
```

Execute the test suite:

```sh
make test
```

Compile and export Plutarch scripts:

```sh
make export
```
